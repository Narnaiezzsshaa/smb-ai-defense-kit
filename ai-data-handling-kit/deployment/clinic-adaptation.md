## HIPAA-Compliant Data Classification

### Enhanced Classification Matrix for Healthcare

| Level | Healthcare Data Types | HIPAA Category | AI Use Restrictions |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **L1 üî¥** | Patient PHI, medical records, test results, genetic data | Protected Health Information | No AI training without authorization |
| **L2 üü°** | De-identified patient data, aggregated health statistics | Limited Data Set | AI training with data use agreement |
| **L3 üü¢** | Administrative data, staff communications, operational metrics | Non-PHI | Standard AI processing permitted |
| **L4 üîµ** | Published research, public health data, educational materials | Public Information | Unrestricted AI use |

### HIPAA Minimum Necessary Standard
- **Collection:** Collect only PHI necessary for specific AI use case
- **Use:** Limit AI processing to minimum necessary for intended purpose
- **Disclosure:** Share only minimum necessary data with AI vendors
