# üóÉÔ∏è AI Data Classification Matrix

## Classification Framework

### Data Sensitivity Levels

| Level | Label | Description | AI Use Restrictions | Retention Period |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **L1** | üî¥ **Restricted** | Personal health data, financial records, biometric data | No AI training, local processing only | As required by law |
| **L2** | üü° **Confidential** | Personal identifiers, customer data, proprietary algorithms | Encrypted AI training only, audit trail required | 7 years max |
| **L3** | üü¢ **Internal** | Business communications, operational metrics, employee data | AI training permitted with consent | 3 years max |
| **L4** | üîµ **Public** | Marketing materials, published research, public statements | Unrestricted AI use | Indefinite |

## AI Training Data Classification

### Input Data Assessment

```markdown
Data Source: _________________
Classification Level: [ ] L1 [ ] L2 [ ] L3 [ ] L4

Assessment Criteria:
‚ñ° Contains personal identifiers (names, SSN, email)
‚ñ° Includes protected health information (PHI)
‚ñ° Contains financial account information
‚ñ° Includes biometric or genetic data
‚ñ° Contains proprietary business information
‚ñ° Includes customer communication records
‚ñ° Contains employee personal information
‚ñ° Includes trade secrets or IP

Geographic Considerations:
‚ñ° EU residents (GDPR applies)
‚ñ° California residents (CCPA applies)
‚ñ° Healthcare context (HIPAA applies)
‚ñ° Financial context (SOX/PCI applies)
```

### Output Data Classification

```markdown
AI-Generated Content: _________________
Derived Classification: [ ] L1 [ ] L2 [ ] L3 [ ] L4

Output Assessment:
‚ñ° Could reveal personal information through inference
‚ñ° Contains synthetic but realistic personal data
‚ñ° Includes business-sensitive insights or predictions
‚ñ° Could be used to identify individuals
‚ñ° Contains financial predictions or recommendations
‚ñ° Includes health-related predictions or recommendations
