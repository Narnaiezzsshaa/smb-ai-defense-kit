```

### Model Outputs and Derivatives
- **Generated Content:** Inherit classification of source training data
- **Model Weights:** Retain for model versioning (2 years post-retirement)
- **Inference Logs:** Retain per data classification (L2: 1 year, L3: 6 months)
- **Bias Testing Results:** Retain for audit purposes (5 years)
- **Performance Metrics:** Retain for optimization (2 years post-model retirement)

### Federated Learning Considerations
- **Local Model Updates:** Delete after aggregation (30 days maximum)
- **Aggregated Models:** Standard retention per classification
- **Participation Logs:** Retain for audit (1 year)
- **Node Contributions:** Anonymized metrics only (2 years)

## Deletion Procedures

### Automated Deletion Workflows

**Daily Automated Tasks:**
```bash
# Check for expired data
./tools/check-expired-data.sh --classification=all

# Process deletion queue
./tools/process-deletions.sh --verify-before-delete

# Generate deletion reports
./tools/deletion-report.sh --output=daily-deletion-$(date +%Y%m%d).pdf
```

**Weekly Automated Tasks:**
```bash
# Full retention audit
./tools/retention-audit.sh --full-scan

# Legal hold verification
./tools/legal-hold-check.sh

# Backup verification and pruning
./tools/backup-cleanup.sh --older-than=retention-period
```

### Manual Deletion Triggers

#### Data Subject Requests
**Timeline:** 30 days from verified request  
**Process:**
1. Verify identity and request validity
2. Locate all data instances (including backups)
3. Assess legal obligations to retain
4. Execute deletion if permissible
5. Provide confirmation to data subject

#### Right to be Forgotten (GDPR)
**Timeline:** 30 days from request  
**Scope:** All personal data unless legal exemption applies  
**Process:**
```bash
# Initiate GDPR deletion request
./tools/gdpr-deletion-request.sh --subject-id="[ID]" --verification="[proof]"

# Scan all systems for subject data
./tools/subject-data-scan.sh --subject-id="[ID]" --include-backups

# Execute deletion across all systems
./tools/execute-gdpr-deletion.sh --request-id="[ID]" --confirm-all
```

#### Business Decision Deletion
**Timeline:** Next scheduled maintenance window  
**Process:**
1. Business justification documented
2. Data classification review
3. Legal/compliance approval
4. Technical deletion execution
5. Audit trail documentation

### Secure Deletion Standards

#### Local Storage Deletion
- **Standard:** NIST SP 800-88 Guidelines
- **Method:** Cryptographic erasure for encrypted data, overwriting for unencrypted
- **Verification:** Post-deletion scanning to confirm removal
- **Documentation:** Certificate of destruction for L1/L2 data

#### Cloud Storage Deletion
- **Provider Verification:** Obtain deletion confirmation from cloud provider
- **Encryption Key Destruction:** For encrypted data, verify key destruction
- **Multi-Region Cleanup:** Ensure deletion across all geographic regions
- **Service Level Agreements:** Verify compliance with contractual deletion terms

#### Backup System Deletion
- **Identification:** Locate all backup copies across systems
- **Scheduling:** Coordinate deletion with backup rotation cycles
- **Verification:** Confirm removal from archive systems
- **Historical Backups:** Address legacy backups per retention schedule

## Exception Management

### Legal Holds
**Definition:** Suspension of normal deletion due to legal proceedings  
**Process:**
1. Legal counsel identifies affected data
2. Automated deletion disabled for specified datasets
3. Regular review of hold status
4. Lift hold when legal matter concludes

**Documentation:**
```yaml
Legal Hold Record:
  case_id: "CASE-2024-001"
  affected_data: 
    - "customer_communications_2023"
    - "transaction_logs_q1_2024"
  hold_date: "2024-01-15"
  review_date: "2024-04-15"
  status: "active"
  legal_contact: "legal@company.com"
```

### Regulatory Investigations
**Extended Retention:** Data may need extended retention during regulatory investigation  
**Notification:** Privacy officer notified within 24 hours  
**Documentation:** Investigation scope and data preservation requirements

### Business Continuity
**Operational Necessity:** Critical business data may warrant retention extension  
**Approval Process:** Business case review by data governance committee  
**Time Limits:** Maximum 12-month extension, renewable with justification
