## 🧭 Remix Etiquette

- Maintain original badge purpose and consent context when remixing.
- Credit Soft Armor Labs in derivative works, especially signage bundles.
- Use the signage zones respectfully—badges symbolize trust, not compliance theater.

## 🖼️ Emotional Signage Zones

| Zone               | Intent                        | Emotion Mode       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Device Stickers    | Signal endpoint dignity        | Calm Sovereignty   |
| Reception Inboxes  | Show phishing readiness        | Protective Clarity |
| SOC Binders        | Display orchestration logic    | Quiet Authority    |

Badges are not just visual—they orient staff to unseen protection logics. Use signage to invite stewardship, not obedience.

## ✅ Consent Overlay Logic

Each badge links to a briefing or onboarding moment. Before signage deployment:

- Confirm asset appears in access brief or system logic.
- Ensure badge meaning is contextually accurate for the tenant zone.
- If tenant modifies badge intent, update quickstart and description cards accordingly.

## 🪶 Why Quiet Excellence

This kit assumes that most stewards work without fanfare. These assets are:

- Designed for inheritance, not applause.
- Meant to endure phase shifts, staff transitions, and tenant onboarding.
- Rooted in emotional literacy, not coercive logic.

Soft Armor Labs stands for modular governance that protects legacies. This repo is a living scaffold—add, remix, or retire artifacts with dignity.
