# 🧰 WSL Setup Guide

This repo is previewable with zero orchestration, but many stewards prefer visual tools and markdown-friendly terminals. If you're on Windows, WSL is the simplest way to honor that preference.

Note: Requires Windows 10 (2004+) or Windows 11

## 💡 Why WSL?

- Enables Linux-style markdown preview (e.g. `bat`)
- Preserves repo layout and badge logic with dignity
- Requires minimal setup—no Docker, no port forwarding
