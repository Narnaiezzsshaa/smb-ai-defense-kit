# ðŸ§  AI Endpoint â€“ Quickstart Card

**Setup Steps:**
1. Deploy AI-assisted endpoint protection (e.g., EDR with ML logic).
2. Validate agent presence via `agent-verify.sh` or equivalent.
3. Confirm endpoint signage zones (device stickers, workstation overlays).

**Verification Logic:**
- AI agent logs show active threat modeling.
- Endpoint registry includes AI protection flag.

**Tenant Considerations:**
- For clinics: Include in workstation access briefing.
- For SMBs: Add to IT binder and onboarding checklist.
